## Teaching, Advising and/or Instructional Accomplishments

Library faculty should include the following statement at the beginning of this section. This does not count as part of the 750 words.

"NOTE: To support the teaching and research missions of the University, Library faculty are assigned in varying degrees to perform public, technical, archival, and administrative functions. These primary activities are referred to in the Libraries’ T&P Criteria as “Professional Responsibilities” rather than “Teaching” to better reflect the unique and specialized activities in which Library faculty engage."
